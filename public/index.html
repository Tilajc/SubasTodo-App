      content="This application is designed for people who wants to sell items to the best price that the market can provide. The functionality is based on the idea that a person publishes his product to sell at an estimated price (this is not shown to the public) and then the market will give value to it until it reaches the proposed price or surpassing it, in a total of 7 days that the publication lasts, otherwise, the publisher can decide whether to sell the product or not."
